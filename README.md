dotfiles
========

A place for keeping my configuration files synchronized across machines.

Configs have been compiled from various sources:

* [isaacs / dotfiles](https://github.com/isaacs/dotfiles "bash")
* [aroberts / config_files](https://github.com/aroberts/config_files "install.sh, misc")
* [rtomayko / dotfiles](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles "everything")
* [jpalardy / dotfiles](https://github.com/jpalardy/dotfiles "bash, bin/, vim")
* [sontek / dotfiles](https://github.com/sontek/dotfiles "bash, vim")

The [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme is used for the terminal (.Xdefaults and .minttyrc), GNU ls ([.dir_colors](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized)), and vim.
